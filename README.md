Author - Jyothi Palle

# PyBank Solution Details:

## Objective:  
   Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
   * The total number of months included in the dataset
   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

##Script Details:
  * Set Path file to read budget data from resources folder
  * Define working variable lists required like stockmonth, Pnl and pnlchange as 
  * Open and read CSV file, after that read hearder
  * Define the required variables 
  * Loop through the rows to read the data from csv and write variable lists created earlier
  * Check if the cnt eq 1 then retain pnvalue else pnldiff subtracting previous value from the current value 
  * Calculate and define Total Months, Average P&L, Greatest Increase and Decrease P&L change values and corresponding months
  * Set path for txtfile in analysis folder to write the output
  * Open the Text file 
  * Write the output as expected into one variable
  * Print the output to terminal and write the same output to text file

# Pypoll  Solution Details:

## Objective:
  Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Script Details:
  * Set Path file to read elections data from resources folder
  * Define candidate options list and candidate votes dictionary
  * Initialize total counts to Zero
  * Open the csv file and start reading the data
  * After reading header start loop to read each row from the csv file
  * Increment total votes for each read from csvfile and name from csvfile and candidate name list
  * Check if the candidate not exit in candidate options, if true write to candidate name to candidate options and start the counting votes for that candidate
  * Increment votes for that candidate 
  * Define winner name and count variables
  * Assign the output text file location to variable
  * Open the file with write mode
  * Create output header and total votes as per the requirement 
  * Write the output to terminal and text file
  * Loop candidates votes dictionary to get votes and calculate percentage of votes polled
  * Print the results to terminal and text file for each candidate as per requirement
  * Find the winner who received higher votes and print the output to terminal and text file

# Unit 3 Homework: Python

In this assignment, you'll complete two challenges in which you'll apply your new Python skills. 

## Background

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete the **two** Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges present a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges aren't easy, so expect some hard work ahead!

## Setup

Before starting the assignment, be sure to do the following:

* Create a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`. **Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository**.

* Clone the new repository to your computer.

* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for each Python challenge. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

* Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

  * A new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  * A `Resources` folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
  * An `analysis` folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

* Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $22564198
  Average Change: $-8311.11
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  ```

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Your analysis should look similar to the following:


  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 369711
  -------------------------
  Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
  Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
  Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Diana DeGette
  -------------------------
  ```

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Hints and Considerations

* Consider what you've learned so far. You've learned how to import modules like `csv`; to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; and to debug along the way. Using what you've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives. 

* The datasets for these challenges are quite large. This was done purposefully, as it showcases one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. As data analysts, our first instinct is often to go straight to Excel, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling big data.

* Write one script for each dataset provided. Run your script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.

* Feel encouraged to work in groups, but don't shortchange yourself by copying someone else's work. You get what you put in, and the art of programming is extremely unforgiving to those who don't do their own work. 

* Start early, and reach out for help when you need it! Be sure to identify specific questions for your instructors and TAs so that they understand your thought process and can provide targeted guidance.

* Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your work! Also make sure that your repo has a detailed   `README.md` file.
